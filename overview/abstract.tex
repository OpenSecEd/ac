Once you have authenticated users you can support access control -- and this is 
also one of the main reasons to authenticate them in the first place.
Access control aims at controlling who may access what, and how they may access

There are different models and ways to implement access control.
We will give an overview of the possibilities.

This is treated by Chapter 5, followed by Chapters 11 and 12, in 
\citetitle{Gollmann2011cs}~\cite{Gollmann2011cs}.
You are also recommended to read Anderson's treatment of the subject, he treats 
this in Chapters 4, 8, and 9 in 
\citetitle{Anderson2008sea}~\cite{Anderson2008sea}.
Finally, to establish your newly gained knowledge in this area, you should do 
exercises 5.1, 5.2, 5.5, 5.6, 5.8 and 5.9 in \cite{Gollmann2011cs}.
