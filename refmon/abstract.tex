The reference monitor enforces access control policies.
It requires care to implement a reference monitor.
To do this we need to explore what is the trusted computing base and enforcing 
access control on the lower layers in the system architecture.

Gollmann treats this area in Chapter 6 of his book 
\citetitle{Gollmann2011cs}~\cite{Gollmann2011cs}.
Exercises 6.1, 6.3 and 6.5 in \cite{Gollmann2011cs} are recommended for your 
learning.
